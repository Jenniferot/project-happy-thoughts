# Happy Thoughts

I built a "Happy Thoughts" webpage in react using useState and useEffect. Using GET and POST to fetch and send data from and to an API.

## The problem

I decided which components I would put the different elements in and then I started to fetch information from the API. The last thing I did was to build a like button that shows how many likes a post gets. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
