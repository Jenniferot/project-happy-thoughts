# Happy Thoughts

I built a "Happy Thoughts" webpage in react using useState and useEffect. Using GET and POST to fetch and send data from and to an API.

## The problem

I decided which components I would put the different elements in and then I started to fetch information from the API. The last thing I did was to build a like button that shows how many likes a post gets.
